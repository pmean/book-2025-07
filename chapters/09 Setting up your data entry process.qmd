# Setting up your data entry process

So you have data. It is on paper. Or maybe it is computer-readable, but the data has no obvious structure. You have to put in a computer-readable format before you can do any data analysis. You have three choices: database, spreadsheet, or text file.

If you are ambitious, setting up a database might be your best option. There are systems like REDCap (Garcia 2021) that have been adopted by many research organizations. If you are flying solo or if your organization does not have REDCap, lobby hard for this. You and everyone you work with will save time and produce better quality data sets. If you can't convince your boss or if you are flying solo, then still look at a database solution. Microsoft Access for Windows PCs or Claris Filemaker for the Macintosh are not free, but well worth the investment. 

Designing a database for your data entry slows you down at first, and this is a good thing. The setup requires you to think about your data and plan intelligently. This time you invest early in a database will be rewarded richly once you start actually entering your data.

You might consider using a spreadsheet, like Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. Don't do it! There are a million reasons to avoid spreadsheets (Cite EUSPRIG, genome problems, row limitations). Some are specific to a particular spreadsheet, but many are endemic in all spreadsheets. 

Sometimes the data is given to you. There is lots of guidance on how to handle things. The first section of Wilson 2017 is an excellent resource. If you have a text file, watch out for special characters, like the non-breaking space (Simon 2020), the smart or curly quotes (Simon 202a), leading and trailing blanks (Simon 2007) and especially the tab character (Simon)

## Step 1: Arrange your data in a rectangular format

Add text.

## Step 2: Create codes for categorical data

Add text.

## Step 3: Document missing values

Add text.

## The fly in the ointment: longitudinal and repeated measures data

Add text.
